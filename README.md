# .config
Looks nice, but isn't mindblowing or anything.

All these files go to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (personally, it's $HOME/.config).

I also symlinked some files out of the $HOME directory to here to keep all configs in a single place, thus making keeping everything tidy. The `symlinks.sh` is a small script I wrote to do this for me automatically.


I also named this repository `.config` instead of `dotfiles` like literally everyone else because this name allows me to just `git clone` onto my home directory and basically call it a day.


# Cool software I'm using
`i3-gaps`, `polybar`, `picom`, `kitty`, `ranger`, `zsh` (with `oh-my-zsh`), `rofi`,`pcmanfm`, `ncmpcpp`, `mpd`, `neofetch` and `pywal`.


# Credits
...go to the example files of each respective program. No other files were used here; I just edited the default ones (on top of some online help, of course).
