# .config
Looks nice, but nothing out of this world.

All these files go to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (in my case, it's $HOME/.config).

I also symlinked some files out of the $HOME directory to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to keep all configurations in a single place, thus keeping everything tidy-ish. The `symlinks.sh` is a small script that automatically does this.

Also, instead of naming this repository `dotfiles` like everyone else, I just named it `.config` because it allows me to just `git clone` on my $HOME folder and it ***just works***.

# Credits
...go to the example files of each program. No other files were used here; I just edited the default ones (on top of some online help, naturally).

# License
MIT

Basically, it means you can do whatever the hell you want with all this as long as you credit me.
Please tell me if I can't license files of this nature and I'll remove them immediately.
