# .config
Looks nice, but isn't mindblowing or anything.

All these files go inside a `.config` folder, located at the home directory (`$HOME`).

The files `.zshrc` and `.xinitrc` are in this `.config` folder, because symlinked them from the `$HOME` directory.

I also named this repository `.config` instead of `dotfiles` like literally everyone else because this name allows
me to just `git clone` onto my home directory and basically call it a day.

# Programs
`i3-gaps`, `polybar`, `compton`, `kitty`, `zsh` (with `oh-my-zsh`), `rofi`, `pcmanfm`, `ncmpcpp`, `mpd` and `neofetch`.

Also, `blender`.

# Credits
...go to the example files. No other files were used here; I just edited the default ones.
