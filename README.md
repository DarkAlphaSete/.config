# .config
Nothing amazing but I find it comfy.

If you're curious, this repo is called `.config` instead of `dotfiles` (like everyone else does it) because it keeps `git clone`ing simple. (Shhhh, just pretend `git clone <directory>` doesn't exist for a little..)


# Notable pieces of software in use
`sway`,
`waybar`,
`wal`,
`dunst`,
`kitty`,
`vim`,
`pcmanfm`,
`libqalculate` and `qalculate-gtk`,
`xpad`,
`grim`, `slurp` and `wl-clipboard`

I also use `gammastep` but its config isn't here so that I don't doxx myself, as my coordinates are in there haha.

# Credits
All the amazing developers that made all these nice and highly customizable programs. And whoever made their sample configurations.

Mostly means you can do whatever you want as long as I get credit for my part. Do read the license, though, as I am far from anyone knowledgeable in this kind of thing.
